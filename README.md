# Detecting-the-operational-quality-of-tobacco-harvesters-based-on-digital-twins-and-an-improved-YOLO
Tobacco is an important economic crop, and the quality of harvesting affects its benefits and processing.  This study develops a system combining an improved YOLOv10 (SPPELAN, SFA, ASFF) with ByteTrack and digital twin 3D mapping for anomaly detection, enhancing intelligent monitoring and evaluation in tobacco fields.
